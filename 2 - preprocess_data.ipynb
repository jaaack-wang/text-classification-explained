    "## Purposes of data preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "For natural lannguage processing, the ultimate purpose of data preprocessing is to convert text data into numerical data, so that mathematical operations can be run on the dataset inputted. This typically involves two general steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Text tokenization**. Please note that, what I mean by tokenization here is not to simply tokenize a sequence of text into words. The results of text tokenization can be anything depending on what works best for you: whitespace-separated tokens, words, stems (subwords or words), lemma, or even characters (Yes, I do mean characters! Such as \"a, b, c, d...\" for English). Before tokenization, there may be a need of normalizing or standarizing the text, again depending on your needs. Text normalization may include: making all characters lower case, americanizing the spelling, removing extra spaces or stopwords etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Text representation or numericalization**: This is simply to encode the tokenized text data into numerical data where every token (remember that a token can be anything, see above) is mapped to something numerical, which can either be a number or an array of numbers. For machine learning purposes, we usually convert a token into an array of numbers and there are two common approaches to it: one-hot encoding and word embedding. \n",
    "    <br><br>\n",
    "    - **One-hot encoding**. As suggested by the name, encodes every token into a sparse array that has as many elements as your vocabulary (unique token) size, where only the element whose index equal to the index of the token in your vocabulary will be 1 whereas the rest will be 0. For example, we have a vocabulary of 10,000 tokens. Say we have a token which happens to be \"token\" is the 4th word in the vocabulary. By one-hot encoding convention, the token \"token\" will be encoded as $(0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0...0)$ where there are another 9996 zeros after 1.\n",
    "    <br><br>\n",
    "    - **Word embedding**. Word embedding is just a conventional name. In practice, we can embed any token the same way we embed words. The basic idea of word embedding is to convert words into a set of much denser arrays where every word (note that here word means token in the same sense as above) is mapped to a much shorter array. To make the array shorter, we need to employ continous floats instead of discrete integers so that a small difference in the floats can mean something. More about word embedding can be seen in the `README.md` file where I explain the general architecture of deep learning models used for text classification. "

All we need is just a vocabulary list (unique tokens) and then create a dictionary that assign every token with an unique number. Then we can reverse the vocabulary dictionary and get another dictionary where number is the key and token is the value. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to get a vobulary list: either create one internally from the text in the train set (but not dev set nor test set because we want to make them untouched), or obtain one externally. If you obtain a vocabulary list externaly, do make sure that the vocabulary list is compatible with the way how you tokenize text. Otherwise, it not very meaningful that the tokens obtained by your tokenizer can barely find unique indices in the vocabulary list. (For example, the vocabulary list is based on words, but your tokenizer tokenizes texts into characters...)\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, unless the vocabulary is definite or can be exclusively listed (characters-based), we will need a special token to map all unseen tokens that may occur from times to times. Usually, we denote such token as `[UNK]` or `<UNK>`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, as the length varies from text to text, whereas deep learning models like to text squences of same length because eventually mathematical (specifically matrix) operations are particular about the dimensions of the data. For example, if two matrices have different dimensions, we cannot do element-wise addition or substraction (in programming world, however, there are certain cases where [`broadcasting`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.broadcasting.html) is allowed). More importanly is the matrix multiplication where two matrices must have compatible (not identical) dimensions such that multiplication can carry out. Nevertheless, a way to get around this is to pad all texts to a length so that every text (entirely or within a batch) is represented by an array of equal length. Typically, we use `[PAD]` or `<PAD>` to denote padded areas. "

For the neural network models represented in this repository, however, we only need to ensure the dimension for text_a or text_b is same within a given batch.
